# Analog Clock Project

## Overview

This project is a simple analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Additionally, quarter markers and numbers for 12, 3, 6, and 9 are added for better readability.

## Project Structure

- HTML (index.html):
  - The main HTML file defines the structure of the clock, including most of the Element you can see in the Website.

- CSS (style.css):
  - The CSS file gives the design for all the Elements that are in in HTML file. But it doesn't only do the disign but also the positioning and other stuff.

- JavaScript (analogClock.js):
  - The JavaScript file is responsible for updating the clock hands' positions based on the current time. It utilizes the `setInterval` function to update the clock every second.
